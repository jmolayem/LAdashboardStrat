## What it is

A lightweight schematic visual representation of a product or service interface.

## Reasons to use it

To prioritize information (substance and relationships) over decoration (style) as you begin defining the solution by keeping the design light. Wireframing also gives designers a great opportunity to start asking developers early questions about feasibility and structure.

## Time required

**Small:** 1-3 hours

## How to do it

1. Build preliminary blueprints that show structure, placement, and hierarchy for your product. Steer clear of font choices, color, or other stylized elements that would distract both the researcher and the reviewer. Lightweight designs are conceptually easier to reconfigure. A few helpful tools for building wireframes are OmniGraffle and Balsamiq, which purposefully keep the wireframe looking like rough sketches.

2. Use this opportunity to start listing what UX/UI patterns you will need.

3. Review your wireframes with specific [user scenarios]({{ '/decide/user-scenarios/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and [personas]({{ '/decide/personas/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) in mind. Can users accomplish their task with the wireframe you are sketching out?

4. Use the wireframes to get the teamâ€™s feedback on feasibility and structure.

## Applied in government research

No PRA implications. No information is collected from members of the public.
