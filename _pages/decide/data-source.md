## What it is

A visualization of the major interactions shaping a user’s experience of a product or service.

## Reasons to use it

To provide design teams with a bird’s-eye view of a design system, helping them see the order, complexity, successes, pain points, and interactions that make up a user’s experience.

## Time required

**Medium:** 4–12 hours

## How to do it

1. Document the elements of the project’s design context. This includes:
 - People involved and their related goals
 - Their behaviors in pursuit of their goals
 - Information, devices, and services that support their behaviors
 - Discrete moments or major decisions they make
 - The emotions associated with these moments or decisions

2. Visualize the order in which people exhibit behaviors, use information, make decisions, and feel emotions. Group elements into a table of “phases” related to the personal narrative of each [persona]({{ '/decide/personas/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}). Identify where personas share contextual components.

3. Discuss the map with stakeholders. Point out insights it offers. Use these insights to establish [design principles]({{ '/decide/design-principles/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}). Think about how to collapse or accelerate a customer’s journey through the various phases. Incorporate this information into the project’s scope.

You can also map user journeys as part of a workshop with stakeholders, similar to a [design studio]({{ '/discover/design-studio/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

## Applied in government research

No PRA implications. The PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation, 5 CFR 1320.3(h)3.
