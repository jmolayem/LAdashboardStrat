## What it is

A simple reference model that correlates existing and potential interfaces with user behaviors.

## Reasons to use it

To help designers anticipate how design decisions might facilitate future behaviors.

## Time required

**Small:** 1–2 hours

## How to do it

1. Create one three-columned table per persona. Label the columns “Past,” “Present Behavior,”  and “Future.”

2. In the middle column (“Present Behavior”), list current user behaviors and pain points broadly related to the project, one per row.

3. In the left-hand column (“Past”), list the products, services, features, and/or interfaces that the user encounters as they go about what’s listed in the present behaviors column.

4. In the right-hand column (“Future”), list possible products, services, features, and/or interface elements that might changes behaviors and pain points in the “present behavior” column in the future.

## Applied in government research

No PRA implications. No information is collected from members of the public.
